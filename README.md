# Overview

The purpose of this program is to show my learning of Networing in a client to server scenario.

The programs I created are, a server program that runs and waits for a connection, once a connection is made it reads what is sent and send the same thing back, and then I created a client program that connects to the server sends "Hello World" and then prints what is returned from the server. 

The purpose of this software was to learn about networking and how clent and server connections are made.

# Network Communication

* Server - Client
* I used TCP with port 65432
* The format of the message sent between Client and server are bytes

# Development Environment

* Python Language
* Visual Studio Code
* Windows Powershell
* Socket Library

# Useful Websites

* [Real Python Socket tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/)

# Future Work

* Make the data sent from Client easily changeable.
* Create more unique server responses.
* Make server able to handle more connections.
